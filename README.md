# SMed_Negation
Natural Language Processing Algorithm designed specifically to determine whether disorders are affirmed or negated in Spanish medical texts.

Coded most of this project as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for UCLA Paisa Project.

I decided to clean up and organize my work in the hopes that some of this might be useful for researchers looking to perform natural language processing on Spanish medical texts!
